## Flappy Bird in Java

This is a simple Flappy Bird game written in Java.

### Gameplay

*  The bird flaps its wings and flies upwards when you press the space bar. 
*  The bird falls due to gravity if you don't press the space bar.
*  Avoid hitting the pipes at the top and bottom of the screen.
*  The score increases with each successful passage between the pipes.
*  The game ends when the bird collides with the pipes or the ground.

### Running the Game

1.  Ensure you have Java installed on your system. You can check by opening a terminal and typing `java -version`. If you don't have Java, download and install it from [Java download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2.  Compile the Java source code for the game. The specific compilation process will depend on your development environment. 
3.  Run the compiled application.

**Note:**  This README assumes a basic understanding of Java development and compilation. 

### Code Structure

The game code will likely be divided into multiple classes:

*  A `FlappyBird` class might handle the overall game loop, including initialization, rendering, and game logic.
*  A `Bird` class might manage the bird's position, movement, and collision detection.
*  A `Pipe` class might represent the individual pipes at the top and bottom of the screen.
*  Additional classes might handle rendering elements like the score and the game over message.

### Restarting the Game

After the game ends, pressing the space bar again should restart the game with a fresh score.

### Additional Notes

* This is a basic implementation. You can extend it by adding features like sound effects, animations, and difficulty levels.
* Consider including comments in your code to explain the logic and functionality.
